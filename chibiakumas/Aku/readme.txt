Intro new:

The town of Nicoyama is in trouble! 
The evil Chibiko is plaguing their land, Killing their 
inhabitants and massacring their neighbors..
And now with the resurrection of her ghoulish 
brother, it seems just a matter of time before they 
are finished... 

In the face of this ultimate evil they knew...
There was only one thing they could do!

It is said that there are two great warriors who roam 
the lands, fighting evil wherever it arises,
That they know no fear, and fight selflessly for justice, 
And that no evil force can stop them! 

And so the residents of Nicoyama 
sent out a call for these heroes...
Knowing that they would surely come 
and save the town in its moment of need!

Unfortunately... They didn't turn up! 

And worse, the infamous 'Hero Twins' did!... 
since being banished from neerby hilltown after a 
'small' ecological disaster, they're looking for a new 
place to prove their mettle!

With their massively over-inflated egos, military
tactics that make 'shock and awe' look like 
passive resistance, and a tendency to only fight 
'selflessly' for justice once securing full 
merchandising rights for the victory movie,
The town is asking themselves 
'Did things just get better... or worse?'

Now Nicoyama is gripped in the ultimate battle 
between insanity and stupidity,
a battle which will decide their fate once and for all!

Whoever wins, the inhabitants of Nicoyama know 
one thing for sure… their town is completely fucked!



Intro new:



「ニコ山」と言う町は今大ピンチ！
凶悪な吸血鬼「ちびこ」は暴走しています、町民を殺して、近くの町を鏖殺しています。。。
然して弟はグールに蘇られた、皆が居なくなるはもうすぐかも。。。

この最悪な敵の前に、一つの解決がある。。。

「この辺りに二つの大英雄が居る」噂がある
何時でも、何処でも、どんな悪魔でも倒すことができる！

ニコ山の人々はこの英雄を助けの求めを出しました！
この二人なら必ず、この混乱に争った人々を助けに来ます！

でも、残念ながら。。。来なかった！

それはともかくでも。。。悪名高いの「勇者」双子が来ました！
最近「小さいな地異を作られた」のために前冷静な町から追い出せられた！
今新しい「自慢の技能を見せる」場所を見つけたい！

自慢過ぎ、敵より信じられない過激な武略、戦利品目指して。。。
人を助けより、この自分が再注目になりたい二人を寄りかかるなんて！

町民は「この助け舟」は救助船より駆逐艦じゃない。。。と思ってる

今「ニコ山」は最悪なチビ悪魔たちと最悪な勇者たちの愚かで狂気な戦いの真ん中！

誰が勝つでも。。。ニコ山の人々は一つの実事が分かてる。。。
これはニコ山の終わり！


Characters:

Chibiko:		
Nikoyama's troublesome resident vampire. Ever since her 'resurrection' she has being causing trouble 
for the town - not content with using the townspeople as her personal food source, she seems to 
consider eradicating the surrounding towns as her personal hobby.

Bochan:
Chibiko's younger brother. Despite dying in an accident so staggeringly stupid it was recorded as 
suicide, in a staggering F-you to millions of years of natural selection, Chibiko brought him back to life 
as an undead Ghoul. While lacking the intelligence to actually do anything bad, he blindly follows 
whatever insane scheme his sister is undertaking.

Yumi Yuusha:
Supreme warrior an military strategist - or at least that's what his bookface profile says! 
Though it's true to say he's had great success defeating evil in the past - 
his reputation dropped somewhat once it was realized no one had survived at all due to his extreme tactics.  
In fact it's now widely considered that his military style breaches both the Geneva convention and kosher butchering laws.

Yume Yuusha:
Spiritualist, Monster hunter and Alchemist! if there's a paycheck at the end of it - she'll believe anything you want!
With her expertise in matters of the Occult, she claims she can solve all the mysteries of the universe - all major credit cards accepted! 
Spends too much time watching 'Pakurimon' cartoons - it would be true to say she'd sell YOUR soul for Pakurimon dolls!


"Magical Girl" Card Hoarder Sakuya
Sakuya is a long standing Nikoyama's resident, Having spent far too long watching cartoons - 
she's decided she will become a "Magical Girl" and save the town!
OK, so it's fair to say she has no powers, skills or even vague abilities...
and it's not quite clear how cosplaying around town, trading 'trajic the hoarding' cards and singing karaoke can save the town,
but hey! she's young, enthusiastic, and wears a miniskirt, and she knows that's all you need to be an anime heroine!
