Do you know where babies come from?
[childs bedroom]
Mom: Well, when a Mommy and Daddy who love each very much, that love becomes a seed, which grows into a baby!
Child: 'Kay... but where do baby VAMPIRES come from?
Mom:Well... when a Mommy and Daddy who don't love each other fuck while high on crack, 
and they have a child because they were to stupid to use protection,
and the child grows up unwanted and unloved, that child will grow up into a sadistic little shit 
who never learns empathy and only knows hatred and anger, and finally after she's tortured 
and maimed everything that's come across her path her body will become 
as dead and corrupted as her soul... and she'll become...

Holy Fucking Shit! I'm back! Welcome to Chibi Akumas Episode 2!
I bet you thought the last game was crazy, but you ain't seen nothing yet!
Huh? I know, you're wondering what happened to this village.
I bet you think *I'm* responsible for this... and that I killed all these people to drink their blood?
Well, you're WRONG!
I did it because I was bored. I'm not responsible for this... shitty TV scheduling is to blame here!
Well, anyway! Let's start the show!

[Yumi]
Yumi: "Begone foul monster! You are not welcome here! I shall banish you from this land!
[Chibiko]
Chibiko: Yeah Right! My mother said that TEN YEARS AGO! she's long gone, and I'm STILL FUCKING HERE!
[Yume]
Yume: I see your corpseulent evil has spread to your stupid brother! No matter! I shall exorcise you both with my awesome spiritual powers!
[Chibiko]
Chibiko: Hey! Don't you call my brother stupid!
Yumi: I shalt give thee one chance to leave, or my sister and I shalt bring the full force of our armies upon you and your brainless brother!
Chibiko: DONT call my brother stupid!
[Yume]
Yume: some mini-vamp and her stupid brother are no match for the "Hero Twins"... once we defeat you to baka we'll be the saviors of the town!
Chibiko: I told you not to call my brother stupid! right that's it! we're totally going to fuck you up - and your crappy 'army'!

--------------------------------
Chibiko:Well, here we go! I've done all  5 levels, it's time for the final battle right?
Yumi:I think not! there is no way you can fight me, because, you see, I AM YOUR FATHER!
chibiko: you what?
chibiko: er?
chibiko: you gotta be kidding me? I seriously have to explain this?
Chibiko: Uhh. 
Chibiko: Yumi... you're EIGHT years old, and I'm NINE and a HALF! 
Chibiko: If you had spent even one nanosecond paying attention in either Maths or bioligy 
class you're realise how FUCKING STUPID what you just said was
Chibiko: I mean, you didn't just go FULL RETARD here, you cranked the retard dial up to 11, broke off 
the knob, and called all your retard friends around for a month long retard block party!
Chibiko: If you had even one atom of self respect you'd be so ashamed at what you just said you'd CUT OFF
YOUR OWN FUCKING HEAD to save yourself from living with the shame of how totally utterly, completely...

Yume: I'm sorry to interrupt this combo of lamest star bores joke, and epic chibiko rant, but can we get on with the final battle?
Chibiko: well, if you want, but I've already whupped both your asses several times - so I don't think it'll last long
Yume: well, you won't be fighting us, We have brought someone back who's wants revenge on you!
Chibiko: someone I've pissed off? Well that just narrows it down to every life form on the plantet!
Yume: remember Sakuya? who you beat in level 2? we've leveled her up to the max! and she's pretty angry with you?
Chibiko: Sakuya? yeah right, I totally maimed her! they're going to need more than dental records to ID that!
Yume: Thanks to Yumi's technology, and my alchemy, nothing is impossible! Behold! the Resurrectifier 5000 PRO!
Chibiko: You totally ripped that machine off from L-fin Lied!
Yume: No, we ripped it off from F.E.I.R ... they ripped it off 'L-fin Lied'
Yume: Behold! We brought Sakuya back! and now she is IMMORTAL!
[Sakuya intro]
[Chibiko vomit]
Chibiko: JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! *I* just threw up in my mouth ... How? I don't even eat!
[Foot]
Chibiko: I mean, what the FUCK have you done? She is a TOTAL mess
[torso]
Chibiko: and there's some nasty green shit leaking out of... well everywhere!
[chest]
Yume: Well.. I'll admit it wasn't a 100% sucess, and I said Immortal, not Invincible!
[Chest]
Chibiko: it wasn't a 1% sucess! and whats all those shards of metal sticking out of her flesh
Yume: Now, she did that herself!... actually I think being brought back to life as a living rotting corpse
has caused her some mental problems
Chibiko: Ya think? No Fucking Shit Sherlock!
Chibiko: I have to say, in the long history of 'yuusha twins' fuckups, I think this one takes the fucktard biscuit!

Sakuya: Chibiko! you Mother Fucker! You think you can just kill ME and get away with it?
Sakuya: You are an insect compared to me! I am destined to be the savior of mankind!
Sakuya: I'm going to rip you to fucking shreads, I'm going to tear the life out of you! and then I'm going skin you alive, and use your corpse as my 'dakki makura'!
Chibiko: Now you watch your lanugage! there may be minors playing this game! hey! are you even listening to me?
Editor's note! (this game is R-18)
Sakuya: H-e-y, bocha-n, you have such nice sparkly eyes, you could lend one to little me couldn't you
Sakuya: I mean, you don't need both do you? won't you give one to me!
Chibiko: Get your filthy fingers OUT of my brother!
Sakuya: You mind your own business! You syphilitic litte bloody cum-rag!
Chibiko: Do you have any idea who you're fucking with? I'm the biggest cause of premature death on this continent!
Chibiko: I hope Yume was right about you being immortal, because now I'm going to enjoy this!
Chibiko: One thousand years after I finish scortching the infestation of stupidity from the planet 
Chibiko: I'm still going to have just started work torturing you!
Chibiko: You're going to spend eternity begging me to kill you, to save you from the 
Chibiko: infinite kaliedoscope of suffering I'm going to inflict on you in the endless misery you'll call your existance!
Sakuya: Ooh Chibiko! you're so fiesty! you say you can beat me... but you're completely underestimating the SIZE of the problem!





--------------------------------
Chibiko: so much for Immortal Sakuya! 
Chibiko: Well, I think we can conclusively say I beat you! now clear this mess up!
Yume: aarg! get me the disinfectant, her gunk is in my ear!
Yumi:I cannot move!
Chibiko: Well that will teach you to be the extras, since I'm the main character, there's hardly any on me! Just like in toastbusters!
Yume:Come on Yumi, lets go, we'll take a bath, and start making new creatures for our next battle!
Chibiko: Yeah! shove off Losers!
Yumi: Yes, do not think you've heard the last of this!
yume: Yeah! we'll be back for a rematch next weekend! I mean...  we can come right?
Chibiko: Um, well I guess so... it's not like anyone else comes to visit.
Chibiko: Damn! why can't I get any proper friends?
Bochan: I wonder!


--------------------------------------------

[screen]
Bochan: You what? I'm not doing that!
Yumi: You must! It's the way of things!
Bochan: It's dumb, and this games boring already!
Yumi: But the developers didn't make enough levels... you have to play the whole game again.
Yumi: And get all the big Diamonds... and XXX ... and buy all the DLC and cut town the tallest tree in the forest with a herring!
Bochan: Well I'm not doing it - so there!
Yumi: But the players not spent enough credits yet, and the developer has to pay the rent.
Bochan: Er, this isn't a real arcade game, it's consumer soft.
Yumi: Hmm, just a moment... I shall have to consult my sister!
Yumi:Mumble mumble
Yume: I told you he wouldn't fall for it! really, play the whole game again? I know he's stupid, but damn!

Yume:Well, Sorry about that interlude! I'm back, and I've brought an old friend whose just DIEing to MEAT you! 
Bochan:Huh? I don't have any friends :-(
Yume:That was sarcasm! idiot... anyway, we've brought Sakuya back, and this time she's Powered up to the MAX!
Bochan:Sakuya, the cosplay girl who can't sing?
Yume:I don't think she's going to like you saying that! Behold! She is back! and this time she's Immortal!
[Sakuya intro]
Bochan: She's a bit messed up
Yume: I did the best I could, Ressurecting people from the dead and turning them into superhumans isn't easy you know!
Yume: Especially when there's pakurimon on half way through, and you.. um.. get destracted and forget about finishing it until the next day and all the ingredients have gone soggy
Bochan: It's still a good effort!
Yume: You think so?
Bochan: Yeah!
Yume: Thanks I try my best, but it's hard, and my pocket money doesn't stretch far enough to...
Sakuya: Would you two fucking annoying brats shut your mouths before I rip out your spinal columns and beat you to death with them!
Sakuya: You are in prescence of the ressurection of the savior of mankind! Bow down and worship me mortals!
Bochan: Whoa! you really powered up her ego!
Sakuya: You pitiful shit for brains fool! I'm going to take great pleasure in vivisecting your pathetic body and harvesting your organs for my own use!
Bochan: You're very rude! and I'm going to have to beat you up!
Sakuya: my my! Such threats! What a naughty boy! I think I'm going to have to give you a SPANKING! 
Sakuya: and I can assure you I'm going to make it hurt YOU a lot more than it hurts me!


--------------------------------
Bochan: Yeah! I win! I R the awesomeiest!
Yume: Well, I think I can safely say today did not go to plan!
Yumi: Our strategy was rather lacking in places it seems!
Bochan: It's sure a mess round here! your mom is going to be angry.
Yume: Er, yes, I didn't think of that!
Yumi: We shall be grounded, for a century!
Bochan: Well, I don't mind helping clean up!
Yume: Really? That's a big help!
Yumi: for a monster, you're quite the gentleman!
